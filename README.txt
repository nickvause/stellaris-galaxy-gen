The goal of this to improve the galaxy generation behaviour for Stellaris (https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris/STST01G-MASTER.html), giving users more controls over the layout and distribution of stars at galaxy generation.

Right now, this is a simple galaxy-generation and star distribution algorithm based upon https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0892.pdf
